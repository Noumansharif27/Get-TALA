## Project: Interactive Website (using Locomotive Scroll, GSAP & ScrollTrigger)

This is a single-page website that utilizes various libraries and frameworks to create a smooth scrolling experience with engaging animations.

**Key Features:**

- **Smooth Scrolling:** Locomotive Scroll removes the default browser scrolling and implements a customized version for a more fluid and visually appealing navigation.
- **Interactive Animations:** GSAP library (GreenSock Animation Platform) is used to create eye-catching animations for various elements like text, images, and sections. ScrollTrigger complements GSAP by allowing animations to be triggered based on the user's scroll position, creating a dynamic and interactive experience.
- **Menu System:** The website features a user-friendly menu that can be toggled with a click. The menu icon also visually indicates its open/closed state.
- **Animated Page Elements:** Animations are implemented for various elements throughout the website, including:
  - Fading-in text and images on scroll
  - Text elements with left/right movement
  - Rotating images
  - Expanding lines
  - Interactive product details revealed on hover
